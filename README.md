Hi, Iâ€™m @odorifqi

I Recently graduated from college in 2021 majoring in computer science. I'm interested in User Interface development and currently focusing my interest to learn about UI/UX development and front-end Web Development with `ReactJS` to implement my design works. I also have some experience in organization as i was involved for two period in my college's Student executive board of Faculty. 

`Iâ€™m Looking forward to step up the game. `
